## Pinpoint

Gather the data that helps improve your app's usability, monetization, and engagement with your users. The CLI deploys your analytics backend using [Amazon Pinpoint](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html).

### Set Up Your Backend

1. Complete the [Get Started TODO link](asdf) steps before you proceed.

2. Use the CLI to add analytics to your cloud-enabled backend and app.

    In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder that typically contains your project level `build.gradle`), and add the SDK to your app.

    ```bash
    $ cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
    $ amplify add analytics
    ```

    In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder contains your app `.xcodeproj` file), and add the SDK to your app.

    ```bash
    $ cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
    $ amplify add analytics
    ```

3. When configuration for analytics is complete, a message appears confirming that you have configured local CLI metadata for this category. You can confirm this by viewing status.

    ```bash
    $ amplify status
    | Category  | Resource name   | Operation | Provider plugin   |
    | --------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
    | Auth      | cognitoabcd0123 | Create    | awscloudformation |
    | Analytics | yourprojectname | Create    | awscloudformation |
    ```

4. To create your backend AWS resources run the following:

    ```bash
    $ amplify push
    ```

### Connect to Your Backend

Use the following steps to add analytics to your mobile app and monitor the results through Amazon Pinpoint.

#### Add Analytics
<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
1. Set up AWS Mobile SDK components by including the following libraries in your `app/build.gradle` dependencies list.

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
      implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-pinpoint:2.7.+'
      implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:2.7.+@aar') { transitive = true }
    }
    ```

    * `aws-android-sdk-pinpoint` library enables sending analytics to Amazon Pinpoint.
    * `aws-android-sdk-mobile-client` library gives access to the AWS credentials provider and configurations.

2. Add required permissions to your app manifest.

    The AWS Mobile SDK requires the `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permissions. These are defined in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
    ```

3. Add calls to capture session starts and stops. A session is one use of an app by the user. A session begins when an app is launched (or brought to the foreground), and ends when the app is terminated (or goes to the background). To accommodate for brief interruptions, like a text message, an inactivity period of up to 5 seconds is not counted as a new session. `Total daily sessions` shows the number of sessions your app has each day. `Average sessions per daily active user` shows the mean number of sessions per user per day.

   The following are typical places where you can instrument your app session start and stop:

   * Start a session in the `Application.onCreate()` method.

   * Start a session in the `onCreate()` method of the app's first activity.

   * Start or stop a session in the [ActivityLifecycleCallbacks](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks) class.

   The following example shows how to start a session in the `OnCreate` event of `MainActivity`.

    ```java
    import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
    import android.os.Bundle;

    import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.PinpointManager;
    import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.PinpointConfiguration;
    import com.amazonaws.mobile.client.AWSMobileClient;

    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
        private static final String TAG = MainActivity.class.getSimpleName();

        public static PinpointManager pinpointManager;

        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

            // Initialize the AWS Mobile Client
            AWSMobileClient.getInstance().initialize(this, new AWSStartupHandler() {
                @Override
                public void onComplete(AWSStartupResult awsStartupResult) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "AWSMobileClient is instantiated and you are connected to AWS!");
                }
            }).execute();

            PinpointConfiguration config = new PinpointConfiguration(
                    MainActivity.this,
                    AWSMobileClient.getInstance().getCredentialsProvider(),
                    AWSMobileClient.getInstance().getConfiguration()
            );
            pinpointManager = new PinpointManager(config);
            pinpointManager.getSessionClient().startSession();
        }
    }
    ```

	To stop the session, use `stopSession()` and `submitEvents()` at the last point in the session you want to capture. In this example, we are using a single Activity, so the session will stop when the MainActivity is destroyed. `onDestroy()` is usually called when the back button is pressed while in the activity.

	```java
	@Override
	protected void onDestroy() {
	    super.onDestroy();

	    pinpointManager.getSessionClient().stopSession();
	    pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().submitEvents();
	}
	```
</div>

#### Monitor Analytics

Build and run your app to see usage metrics in Amazon Pinpoint. When you run the previous code samples, the console shows a logged Session.

1. To see visualizations of the analytics coming from your app, open your project in the Amazon Pinpoint console by running the following:

    ```bash
    $ amplify console analytics
    ```

2. Choose `Analytics` from the icons on the left of the console, and view the graphs of your app's usage. It may take up to 15 minutes for metrics to become visible.

    ![getting-started-analytics](media/getting-started-analytics.png)

    [Learn more about Amazon Pinpoint](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html).

### Enable Custom App Analytics

Instrument your code to capture app usage event information, including attributes you define.  Use graphs of your custom usage event data  in the Amazon Pinpoint console. Visualize how your users' behavior aligns with a model you design using [Amazon Pinpoint Funnel Analytics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/analytics-funnels.html), or use [stream the data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/analytics-streaming.html) for deeper analysis.

Use the following steps to implement Amazon Pinpoint custom analytics for your app.
<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.analytics.AnalyticsEvent;

/**
* Call this method to log a custom event to the analytics client.
*/
public void logEvent() {
   final AnalyticsEvent event =
       pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().createEvent("EventName")
           .withAttribute("DemoAttribute1", "DemoAttributeValue1")
           .withAttribute("DemoAttribute2", "DemoAttributeValue2")
           .withMetric("DemoMetric1", Math.random());

   pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(event);
}
```
</div>
Build, run, and use your app. Then, view your custom events on the `Events` tab of the Amazon Pinpoint console (choose `Analytics`>`Events`). Look for the name of your event in the `Events` menu.

### Enable Revenue Analytics

Amazon Pinpoint supports the collection of monetization event data. Use the following steps to place
and design analytics related to purchases through your app.
<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.analytics.monetization.AmazonMonetizationEventBuilder;

/**
* Call this method to log a monetized event to the analytics client.
*/
public void logMonetizationEvent() {
    final AnalyticsEvent event =
       AmazonMonetizationEventBuilder.create(pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient())
           .withCurrency("USD")
           .withItemPrice(10.00)
           .withProductId("DEMO_PRODUCT_ID")
           .withQuantity(1.0)
           .withProductId("DEMO_TRANSACTION_ID").build();
    pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(event);
}
```
</div>

### Reporting Events in Your Application

You can use the Pinpoint SDK to report usage data, or events, to Amazon Pinpoint. You can report events to capture information such as session times, usersâ€™ purchasing behavior, sign-in attempts, or any custom event type that you need.

After your application reports events, you can view analytics in the Amazon Pinpoint console. The charts on the Analytics page provide metrics for many aspects of user behavior. For more information, see Chart Reference for Amazon Pinpoint Analytics in the Amazon Pinpoint User Guide.

To analyze and store your event data outside of Amazon Pinpoint, you can configure Amazon Pinpoint to stream the data to Amazon Kinesis. For more information, see Streaming Amazon Pinpoint Events to Kinesis.

By using the AWS Mobile SDKs and the AWS Amplify JavaScript libraries, you can call the Amazon Pinpoint API to report the following types of events:

#### Session events
Indicate when and how often users open and close your app.

After your application reports session events, use the Analytics page in the Amazon Pinpoint console to view charts for Sessions, Daily active endpoints, 7-day retention rate, and more.

<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.analytics.SessionClient;

/**
 * Call this method to start and stop a session and submit events recorded
 * in the current session.
 */
public void logSession() {
    SessionClient sessionClient = pinpointManager.getSessionClient();
    sessionClient.startSession();
    sessionClient.stopSession();
    pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().submitEvents();
}
```
</div>

#### Custom events
Are nonstandard events that you define by assigning a custom event type. You can add custom attributes and metrics to a custom event.

On the Analytics page in the console, the Events tab displays metrics for all custom events that are reported by your app. Use graphs of your custom usage event data in the Amazon Pinpoint console. Visualize how your usersâ€™ behavior aligns with a model you design using Amazon Pinpoint Funnel Analytics, or use stream the data for deeper analysis.

Use the following steps to implement Amazon Pinpoint custom analytics for your app.

<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.analytics.AnalyticsEvent;

/**
* Call this method to log a custom event to the analytics client.
*/
public void logEvent() {
   final AnalyticsEvent event =
       pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().createEvent("EventName")
           .withAttribute("DemoAttribute1", "DemoAttributeValue1")
           .withAttribute("DemoAttribute2", "DemoAttributeValue2")
           .withMetric("DemoMetric1", Math.random());
   pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(event);
   pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().submitEvents();
}
```
</div>

Build, run, and use your app. Then, view your custom events on the Events tab of the Amazon Pinpoint console (choose Analytics>Events). Look for the name of your event in the Events menu.


#### Monetization events
Report the revenue thatâ€™s generated by your application and the number of items that are purchased by users.

On the Analytics page, the Revenue tab displays charts for Revenue, Paying users, Units sold, and more.

Use the following steps to implement Amazon Pinpoint monetization analytics for your app.

<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.analytics.monetization.AmazonMonetizationEventBuilder;

/**
* Call this method to log a monetized event to the analytics client.
*/
public void logMonetizationEvent() {
    final AnalyticsEvent event =
       AmazonMonetizationEventBuilder.create(pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient())
           .withCurrency("USD")
           .withItemPrice(10.00)
           .withProductId("DEMO_PRODUCT_ID")
           .withQuantity(1.0)
           .withProductId("DEMO_TRANSACTION_ID").build();
    pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(event);
    pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().submitEvents();
}
```
</div>

#### Authentication events
Indicate how frequently users authenticate with your application.

On the Analytics page, the Users tab displays charts for Sign-ins, Sign-ups, and Authentication failures.

To learn how frequently users authenticate with your app, update your application code so that Amazon Pinpoint receives the following standard event types for authentication:

_userauth.sign_in
_userauth.sign_up
_userauth.auth_fail
You can report authentication events by doing either of the following:


*Managing user sign-up and sign-in with Amazon Cognito user pools.*

Amazon Cognito user pools are user directories that make it easier to add sign-up and sign-in to your app. As users authenticate with your app, Amazon Cognito reports authentication events to Amazon Pinpoint. For more information, see Using Amazon Pinpoint Analytics with Amazon Cognito User Pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.

*Reporting authentication events by using the Amazon Pinpoint client thatâ€™s provided by the AWS Mobile SDK for Android.*

If you donâ€™t want to use Amazon Cognito user pools, you can use the Amazon Pinpoint client to record and submit authentication events, as shown in the following examples. In these examples, the event type is set to `_userauth.sign_in`, but you can substitute any authentication event type.
<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.analytics.AnalyticsEvent;

/**
* Call this method to log an authentication event to the analytics client.
*/
public void logAuthenticationEvent() {
   final AnalyticsEvent event =
       pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().createEvent("_userauth.sign_in");
   pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(event);
   pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().submitEvents();
}
```
</div>

### Managing Sessions in Your Application

As users engage with your app, it reports information about app sessions to Amazon Pinpoint, such as session start times, session end times, and events that occur during sessions. To report this information from an Android application, your app must include methods that handle events as your app enters the foreground and the background on the user's Android device.

**Example Lifecycle Manager**

The following example class, `AbstractApplicationLifeCycleHelper`, implements the `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` interface to track when the application enters the foreground or background, among other states. Add this class to your app, or use it as an example for how to update your code:

<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
package com.amazonaws.mobile.util;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.app.Application;
import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.IntentFilter;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;

import java.util.WeakHashMap;

/**
 * Aids in determining when your application has entered or left the foreground.
 * The constructor registers to receive Activity lifecycle events and also registers a
 * broadcast receiver to handle the screen being turned off.  Abstract methods are
 * provided to handle when the application enters the background or foreground.
 * Any activity lifecycle callbacks can easily be overriden if additional handling
 * is needed. Just be sure to call through to the super method so that this class
 * will still behave as intended.
 **/
public abstract class AbstractApplicationLifeCycleHelper implements Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks {
    private static final String LOG_TAG = AbstractApplicationLifeCycleHelper.class.getSimpleName();
    private static final String ACTION_SCREEN_OFF = "android.intent.action.SCREEN_OFF";
    private boolean inForeground = false;
    /** Tracks the lifecycle of activities that have not stopped (including those restarted). */
    private WeakHashMap<Activity, String> activityLifecycleStateMap = new WeakHashMap<>();

    /**
     * Constructor. Registers to receive activity lifecycle events.
     * @param application The Android Application class.
     */
    public AbstractApplicationLifeCycleHelper(final Application application) {
        application.registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(this);
        final ScreenOffReceiver screenOffReceiver = new ScreenOffReceiver();
        application.registerReceiver(screenOffReceiver, new IntentFilter(ACTION_SCREEN_OFF));
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivityCreated(final Activity activity, final Bundle bundle) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "onActivityCreated " + activity.getLocalClassName());
        handleOnCreateOrOnStartToHandleApplicationEnteredForeground();
        activityLifecycleStateMap.put(activity, "created");
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivityStarted(final Activity activity) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "onActivityStarted " + activity.getLocalClassName());
        handleOnCreateOrOnStartToHandleApplicationEnteredForeground();
        activityLifecycleStateMap.put(activity, "started");
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivityResumed(final Activity activity) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "onActivityResumed " + activity.getLocalClassName());
        activityLifecycleStateMap.put(activity, "resumed");
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivityPaused(final Activity activity) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "onActivityPaused " + activity.getLocalClassName());
        activityLifecycleStateMap.put(activity, "paused");
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivityStopped(final Activity activity) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "onActivityStopped " + activity.getLocalClassName());
        // When the activity is stopped, we remove it from the lifecycle state map since we
        // no longer consider it keeping a session alive.
        activityLifecycleStateMap.remove(activity);
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivitySaveInstanceState(final Activity activity, final Bundle outState) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "onActivitySaveInstanceState " + activity.getLocalClassName());
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivityDestroyed(final Activity activity) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "onActivityDestroyed " + activity.getLocalClassName());
        // Activity should not be in the activityLifecycleStateMap any longer.
        if (activityLifecycleStateMap.containsKey(activity)) {
            Log.wtf(LOG_TAG, "Destroyed activity present in activityLifecycleMap!?");
            activityLifecycleStateMap.remove(activity);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Call this method when your Application trims memory.
     * @param level the level passed through from Application.onTrimMemory().
     */
    public void handleOnTrimMemory(final int level) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "onTrimMemory " + level);
        // If no activities are running and the app has gone into the background.
        if (level >= Application.TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN) {
            checkForApplicationEnteredBackground();
        }
    }

    class ScreenOffReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            checkForApplicationEnteredBackground();
        }
    }

    /**
     * Called back when your application enters the Foreground.
     */
    protected abstract void applicationEnteredForeground();

    /**
     * Called back when your application enters the Background.
     */
    protected abstract void applicationEnteredBackground();

    /**
     * Called from onActivityCreated and onActivityStarted to handle when the application enters
     * the foreground.
     */
    private void handleOnCreateOrOnStartToHandleApplicationEnteredForeground() {
        // if nothing is in the activity lifecycle map indicating that we are likely in the background, and the flag
        // indicates we are indeed in the background.
        if (activityLifecycleStateMap.size() == 0 && !inForeground) {
            inForeground = true;
            // Since this is called when an activity has started, we now know the app has entered the foreground.
            applicationEnteredForeground();
        }
    }

    private void checkForApplicationEnteredBackground() {
        ThreadUtils.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                // If the App is in the foreground and there are no longer any activities that have not been stopped.
                if ((activityLifecycleStateMap.size() == 0) && inForeground) {
                    inForeground = false;
                    applicationEnteredBackground();
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```
</div>

**Reporting Session Events**

After you include the `AbstractApplicationLifeCycleHelper` class, implement the two abstract methods, `applicationEnteredForeground` and `applicationEnteredBackground`, in the `Application` class. These methods enable your app to report the following information to Amazon Pinpoint:

1. Session start times (when the app enters the foreground).

2. Session end times (when the app enters the background).

3. The events that occur during the app session, such as monetization events. This information is reported when the app enters the background.

The following example shows how to implement `applicationEnteredForeground` and `applicationEnteredBackground`. It also shows how to call `handleOnTrimMemory` from inside the `onTrimMemory` function of the `Application` class: 

<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.PinpointConfiguration;
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.PinpointManager;

public class Application extends MultiDexApplication {
    public static PinpointManager pinpointManager;
    private AbstractApplicationLifeCycleHelper applicationLifeCycleHelper;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        // . . .
           
        // The Helper registers itself to receive application lifecycle events when it is constructed.
        // A reference is kept here in order to pass through the onTrimMemory() call from
        // the Application class to properly track when the application enters the background.
        applicationLifeCycleHelper = new AbstractApplicationLifeCycleHelper(this) {
            @Override
            protected void applicationEnteredForeground() {
                Application.pinpointManager.getSessionClient().startSession();
                // handle any events that should occur when your app has come to the foreground...
            }

            @Override
            protected void applicationEnteredBackground() {
                Log.d(LOG_TAG, "Detected application has entered the background.");
                Application.pinpointManager.getSessionClient().stopSession();
                Application.pinpointManager.getAnalyticsClient().submitEvents();
                // handle any events that should occur when your app has gone into the background...
            }
        };
    }

    private void updateGCMToken() {
        try {
            final String gcmToken = InstanceID.getInstance(this).getToken(
                    "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
                    GoogleCloudMessaging.INSTANCE_ID_SCOPE
            );
            Application.pinpointManager.getNotificationClient().registerGCMDeviceToken(gcmToken);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onTrimMemory(final int level) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "onTrimMemory " + level);
        applicationLifeCycleHelper.handleOnTrimMemory(level);
        super.onTrimMemory(level);
    }

}
```
</div>

You've updated your Android app to report session information. Now, when users open and close your app, you can see session metrics in the Amazon Pinpoint console, including those shown by the *Sessions* and *Session heat map* charts. 

### Registering Endpoints in Your Application

When a user starts a session (for example, by launching your mobile app), your mobile or web application can automatically register (or update) an endpoint with Amazon Pinpoint. The endpoint represents the device that the user starts the session with. It includes attributes that describe the device, and it can also include custom attributes that you define. Endpoints can also represent other methods of communicating with customers, such as email addresses or mobile phone numbers.

After your application registers endpoints, you can segment your audience based on endpoint attributes. You can then engage these segments with tailored messaging campaigns. You can also use the Analytics page in the Amazon Pinpoint console to view charts about endpoint registration and activity, such as New endpoints and Daily active endpoints.

You can assign a single user ID to multiple endpoints. A user ID represents a single user, while each endpoint that is assigned the user ID represents one of the userâ€™s devices. After you assign user IDs to your endpoints, you can view charts about user activity in the console, such as Daily active users and Monthly active users.

#### Adding Custom Endpoint Attributes

After you initialize the Amazon Pinpoint client in your application, you can add custom attributes to endpoints.

<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.analytics.AnalyticsEvent;

public void addCustomEndpointAttribute() {
    // Add a custom attribute to the endpoint
    TargetingClient targetingClient = pinpointManager.getTargetingClient();
    String[] interests = new String[] {"science", "politics", "travel"};
    targetingClient.addAttribute("interests", Arrays.asList(interests));
    targetingClient.updateEndpointProfile();
    Log.d(TAG, "Updated custom attributes for endpoint: " +
            targetingClient.currentEndpoint().getEndpointId());
}
```
</div>


#### Assigning User IDs to Endpoints
Assign user IDs to endpoints by doing either of the following:

Manage user sign-up and sign-in with Amazon Cognito user pools.
Use the Amazon Pinpoint client to assign user IDs without using Amazon Cognito user pools.
Amazon Cognito user pools are user directories that make it easier to add sign-up and sign-in to your app. When the AWS Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android register an endpoint with Amazon Pinpoint, Amazon Cognito automatically assigns a user ID from the user pool. For more information, see Using Amazon Pinpoint Analytics with Amazon Cognito User Pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.

If you donâ€™t want to use Amazon Cognito user pools, you can use the Amazon Pinpoint client in your application to assign user IDs to endpoints.

<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.targeting.TargetingClient;
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.targeting.endpointProfile.EndpointProfileUser;
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.targeting.endpointProfile.EndpointProfile;

## Kinesis

### Overview

Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed service for real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale.
Kinesis can collect and process hundreds of terabytes of data per hour from hundreds of thousands of
sources, so you can write applications that process information in real-time. With Kinesis
applications, you can build real-time dashboards, capture exceptions and generate alerts, drive
recommendations, and make other real-time business or operational decisions. You can also easily
send data to other services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Redshift.

The AWS Mobile SDK for Android provides simple, high-level clients designed to help you interface with Kinesis. The
Kinesis clients let you store streaming data on disk and then send them all at once.  This is useful
because many mobile applications that use Kinesis will create multiple data requests per second.
Sending one data request for each action could adversely impact battery life. Moreover, the requests
could be lost if the device goes offline. Thus, using the high-level Kinesis client for batching can
preserve both battery life and data.

For information about Kinesis Region availability, see  
[AWS Service Region Availability](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).

To get started using the Amazon Kinesis mobile client, you'll need to integrate the SDK for Android
into your app, set the appropriate permissions, and import the necessary libraries.


#### What is Kinesis Data Firehose?

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such
as Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift. With Kinesis Data Firehose, you do not need to write any applications or manage any resources. You
configure your data producers to send data to Firehose and it automatically delivers the data to the
destination that you specified.

`KinesisFirehoseRecorder` is the high level client for Kinesis Data Firehose. Its usage is very similar to
that of `KinesisRecorder`.

For more information about Kinesis Data Firehose, see [Amazon Kinesis Firehose](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html).

You can also learn more about how the Kinesis services work together on the following page: [Amazon Kinesis services](http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/).

### Getting Started

#### Create an Identity Pool

To use AWS services in your mobile application, you must obtain AWS Credentials using |COGID| as
your credential provider. Using a credentials provider allows you to access AWS services without
having to embed your private credentials in your application. This also allows you to set
permissions to control which AWS services your users have access to.

The identities of your application's users are stored and managed by an identity pool, which is a
store of user identity data specific to your account. Every identity pool has roles that specify
which AWS resources your users can access. Typically, a developer will use one identity pool per
application. For more information on identity pools, see the [Cognito Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/devguide/identity/identity-pools/).

To create an identity pool for your application:

1. Log in to the `Cognito Console <cognito>` and click `Create new identity
   pool`.

2. Enter a name for your Identity Pool and check the check box to enable access to unauthenticated
   identities. Click `Create Pool` to create your identity pool.

3. Click `Allow` to create the roles associated with your identity pool.

The next page displays code that creates a credentials provider so you can easily integrate |COGID|
in your Android application.

For more information on Cognito Identity, see `how-to-cognito-integrate-an-existing-identity-pool`.

#### Set IAM Permissions (Amazon Kinesis)

To use Amazon Kinesis in an application, you must set the correct permissions. The following IAM
policy allows the user to submit records to a Kinesis stream identified by [ARN](./aws-arns-and-namespaces):

```json
{
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "kinesis:PutRecords",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:111122223333:stream/mystream"
    }]
}
```
This policy should be applied to roles assigned to the Cognito identity pool, but you need to
replace the `Resource` value with the correct ARN for your Kinesis stream. You can apply
policies at the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)


#### Set IAM Permissions (Amazon Kinesis Firehose)

Amazon Kinesis Firehose needs slightly different permission. The following IAM policy allows the
user to submit records to an Amazon Kinesis Firehose stream identified by the Amazon Resource Name
(ARN):

```json
{
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "firehose:PutRecordBatch",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:firehose:us-west-2:111122223333:deliverystream/mystream"
    }]
}
```

For more information about ARN formatting and example policies, see
[Amazon Resource Names for Amazon Kinesis](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-iam.html#kinesis-using-iam-arn-format).

To learn more about Kinesis-specific policies, see
[Controlling Access to Amazon Kinesis Resources with IAM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-iam.html).

To learn more about IAM policies, see
[Using IAM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_Introduction.html).

#### Include the SDK in Your Project

Follow the instructions on the
[Set Up the SDK for Android](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/setup.html)
page to include the proper JAR files for this service and set the appropriate permissions.

##### Set Permissions in Your Android Manifest

In your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, add the following permission:

```java
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
##### Add Import Statements

Add the following imports to the main activity of your app.

```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.kinesis.kinesisrecorder.*;
import com.amazonaws.auth.CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider;
import com.amazonaws.regions.Regions;
```

### Instantiate a Kinesis Recorder

Once you've imported the necessary libraries and have your credentials object, you can instantiate `KinesisRecorder`. `KinesisRecorder` is a high-level client meant for storing PutRecord requests on an Android device. Storing requests on the device lets you retain data when the device is offline, and it can also increase performance and battery efficiency since the network doesn't need to be awakened as frequently.

`KinesisRecorder` uses synchronous calls, so you shouldn't call `KinesisRecorder` methods on the main thread.

When you create the `KinesisRecorder` client, you'll pass in a directory and an AWS region. The directory should be empty the first time you instantiate `KinesisRecorder`; it should be private to your application; and, to prevent collision, it should be used only by `KinesisRecorder`.  The following snippet creates a directory and instantiates the `KinesisRecorder` client, passing in a Cognito credentials object (`cognitoProvider`), a region enum, and the directory.
<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
String kinesisDirectory = "YOUR_UNIQUE_DIRECTORY";
KinesisRecorder recorder = new KinesisRecorder(
 myActivity.getDir(kinesisDirectory, 0),
 Regions.US_WEST_2,
 credentialsProvider
);
```
You'll use `KinesisRecorder` to save records and then send them in a batch.

```java
recorder.saveRecord("MyData".getBytes(), "MyStreamName");
recorder.submitAllRecords();
```
For the `saveRecord()` request above to work, you would have to have created a stream named `MyStreamName`. You can create new streams in the [Amazon Kinesis console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis).

If `submitAllRecords()` is called while the app is online, requests will be sent and removed from the disk. If `submitAllRecords()` is called while the app is offline, requests will be kept on disk until `submitAllRecords()` is called while online. This applies even if you lose your internet connection midway through a submit. So if you save ten requests, call `submitAllRecords()`, send five, and then lose the Internet connection, you have five requests left on disk. These remaining five will be sent the next time `submitAllRecords()` is invoked online.

To see how much space the `KinesisRecorder` client is allowed to use, you can call `getDiskByteLimit()`.

```java
Long byteLimit = recorder.getDiskByteLimit();
// Do something with byteLimit
```
Alternatively, you can retrieve the same information by getting the `KinesisRecorderConfig` object for the recorder and calling `getMaxStorageSize():`

```java
KinesisRecorderConfig kinesisRecorderConfig = recorder.getKinesisRecorderConfig();
Long maxStorageSize = kinesisRecorderConfig.getMaxStorageSize();
// Do something with maxStorageSize
```
</div>

#### Storage limits

If you exceed the storage limit for `KinesisRecorder`, requests will not be saved or sent. `KinesisRecorderConfig` has a default `maxStorageSize` of 8 MiB. You can configure the maximum allowed storage via the `withMaxStorageSize()` method of `KinesisRecorderConfig`.

To check the number of bytes currently stored in the directory passed in to the `KinesisRecoder` constructor, call `getDiskBytesUsed()`:
<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
Long bytesUsed = recorder.getDiskBytesUsed();
// Do something with bytesUsed
```
</div>

To learn more about working with Amazon Kinesis, see [Amazon Kinesis Developer Resources](http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/developer-resources/). To learn more about the Kinesis classes, see the [API Reference for the Android SDK](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSAndroidSDK/latest/javadoc/).


### Use KinesisFirehoseRecorder

To use `KinesisFirehoseRecorder`, you need to pass the object in a directory where streaming data is saved. We recommend you use an app private directory because the data is not encrypted.
<div id="java" class="tab-content current">
```java
// Gets a working directory for the recorder
File directory = context.getCachedDir();
// Sets Firehose region
Regions region = Regions.US_WEST_2;
// Initialize a credentials provider to access Amazon Kinesis Firehose
AWSCredentialsProvider provider = new CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider(
    context, "identityPoolId",
    Regions.US_EAST_1); // region of your Amazon Cognito identity pool
KinesisFirehoseRecorder firehoseRecorder = new KinesisFirehoseRecorder(
    directory, region, provider);

// Start to save data, either a String or a byte array
firehoseRecorder.saveRecord("Hello world!\n");
firehoseRecorder.saveRecord("Streaming data to Amazon S3 via Amazon Kinesis Firehose is easy.\n");

// Send previously saved data to Amazon Kinesis Firehose
// Note: submitAllRecords() makes network calls, so wrap it in an AsyncTask.
new AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void>() {
   @Override
   protected Void doInBackground(Void... v) {
       try {
           firehoseRecorder.submitAllRecords();
       } catch (AmazonClientException ace) {
           // handle error
       }
   }
}.execute();
```
</div>
