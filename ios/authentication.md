# Authentication

Enable your users to sign-in using credentials from Facebook, Google, or your own custom user directory. The CLI deploys [Amazon Cognito identity pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html) and [user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html) to create your backend.

## Guest access


## Customize the SDK Sign-In UI

By default, the SDK presents sign-in UI for each sign in provider you enable in your Mobile Hub project (Email and Password, Facebook, Google) with a default look and feel. It knows which provider(s) you chose by reading the `awsconfiguration.json` file you integrated with your app.

To override the defaults, and modify the behavior, look, and feel of the sign-in UI, create an `AuthUIConfiguration` object and set the appropriate properties.


iOS - Swift

Create and configure an `AWSAuthUIConfiguration` object and set its properties.

Create and configure an `AuthUIConfiguration` object.

* To present the Email and Password user `SignInUI`, set `enableUserPoolsUI` to `true`.

* To present Facebook or Google  user `SignInUI`, add `.addSignInButtonView(class: AWSFacebookSignInButton.self)` or `.addSignInButtonView(class: AWSFacebookSignInButton.self)`.

* To change the logo, use `logoImage`.

* To change the background color, use `backgroundColor`.

* To cancel the sign-in flow, use `canCancel`.

* To change the font in the sign-in views, use the `font` property and pass in the `UIFont` object that represents a font family.

* To draw the `backgroundColor` full screen, use `fullScreenBackgroundColor`.

```swift
import UIKit
import AWSAuthUI
import AWSMobileClient
import AWSUserPoolsSignIn
import AWSFacebookSignIn
import AWSGoogleSignIn

class SampleViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        if !AWSSignInManager.sharedInstance().isLoggedIn {
            presentAuthUIViewController()
        }
    }

    func presentAuthUIViewController() {
        let config = AWSAuthUIConfiguration()
        config.enableUserPoolsUI = true
        config.addSignInButtonView(class: AWSFacebookSignInButton.self)
        config.addSignInButtonView(class: AWSGoogleSignInButton.self)
        config.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue
        config.font = UIFont (name: "Helvetica Neue", size: 20)
        config.isBackgroundColorFullScreen = true
        config.canCancel = true

        AWSAuthUIViewController.presentViewController(
            with: self.navigationController!,
            configuration: config, completionHandler: { (provider: AWSSignInProvider, error: Error?) in
                if error == nil {
                    // SignIn succeeded.
                } else {
                    // end user faced error while loggin in, take any required action here.
                }
        })
    }
}
```

## Set Up Facebook Authentication

To use the following Facebook service configuration steps to federate Facebook as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, try the AWS Amplify [User Sign-in feature](./add-aws-mobile-user-sign-in).

You must first register your application with Facebook by using the [Facebook Developers portal](https://developers.facebook.com/).

AWS Amplify generates code that enables you to use Facebook to provide federated authentication for your mobile app users. This topic explains how to set up Facebook as an identity provider for your app.

If you already have a Facebook app ID, copy and paste it into the `Facebook App ID` field
when configuring authentication using the AWS Amplify CLI.

**To get a Facebook app ID**

1. In the [Facebook Developers portal](https://developers.facebook.com/), sign in with your
   Facebook credentials.

2. From `Create App`, choose `Add a New App` (note: this menu label will be
   `My Apps` if you have previously created an app.

![Image](./images/new-facebook-app.png)

3. If asked, choose the platform of your app that will use Facebook sign-in, and `basic
   setup`.

4. Type a display name for your app, select a category for your app from the `Category`
   drop-down list, and then choose `Create App ID`.

![Image](./images/new-facebook-app-new-app-id.png)


5. Complete the `Security Check` that appears. Your new app then appears in the
   `Dashboard`.

![Image](./images/new-facebook-app-id.png)

6. Copy the App ID and paste it into the `Facebook App ID` field in the Mobile Hub console.

![Image](./images/facebook-app-id-console-entry.png)

7. In the Facebook Developer portal's left hand navigation list, choose `Settings`, then
   choose `+ Add Platform`.

![Image](./images/new-facebook-add-platform.png)

8. Choose your platform and provide information about your app that Facebook will use for
   integration during credential validation.

   `For iOS:`

      1. Add your app's Bundle ID. (for example, com.amazon.YourProjectName).

![Image](./images/new-facebook-add-platform-ios.png)


9. In the Facebook Developers portal, choose `Save changes`, then `Use this
   package name` if a dialog appears saying that Google Play has an issue with your package name.

10. Only users with roles assigned in the Facebook portal will be able to authenticate through your
   app while it is in development (not yet published).

    To authorize users, in the Facebook Developer portal's left hand navigation list, choose
    `Roles`, then `Add Testers`. Provide a valid Facebook ID.

![Image](./images/new-facebook-add-testers.png)


11. In the Mobile Hub console, choose `Save changes`.

For more information about integrating with Facebook Login, see the [Facebook Getting Started Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login).

## Set Up Google Authentication

To use the following Google service configuration steps to federate Google as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, try the AWS Amplify [User Sign-in feature](./add-aws-mobile-user-sign-in).

With AWS Amplify, you can configure a working Google Sign-In feature for both Android and iOS apps. To fully integrate Google Sign-In with your app, AWS Amplify needs information that comes from Google's setup process.

The following pages detail the Google Sign-In requirements ans steps to integrate Google Sign-In for both iOS and Android apps.

* `auth-google-create-google-project` (required for `all apps` regardless of platform)

* `auth-google-create-oauth-android-clientid` (required for all Android apps)

* `auth-google-create-oauth-ios-clientid` (required for all iOS apps)


## Add sign-in

1. Add code to create an instance of `AWSMobileClient` in the `application:open url` function  of your `AppDelegate.swift`, to resume a previously signed-in authenticated session.

	Then add another instance of `AWSMobileClient` in the `didFinishLaunching` function to register the sign in providers, and to fetch an Amazon Cognito credentials that AWS will use to authorize access once the user signs in.

	```swift
	 import UIKit
	 import AWSMobileClient

	 @UIApplicationMain

	 class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

	     // Add an AWSMobileClient call in application:open url
	     func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL,
	         sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {

	         return AWSMobileClient.sharedInstance().interceptApplication(
	             application, open: url,
	             sourceApplication: sourceApplication,
	             annotation: annotation)

	     }

	     // Add an AWSMobileClient call in application:didFinishLaunching
	     func application(
	         _ application: UIApplication,
	             didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:
	                 [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

	          return AWSMobileClient.sharedInstance().interceptApplication(
	              application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
	              launchOptions)
	     }

	     // Other functions in AppDelegate . . .

	   }
	```

2. Make sure you have a `UINavigationController` in your app to use the sign-in UI. The sign-in UI uses the `UINavigationController` as an anchor to perform all the transitions. Learn more about using [UINavigationController](https://medium.com/whoknows-swift/swift-the-hierarchy-of-uinavigationcontroller-programmatically-91631990f495).

3. Implement your sign-in UI by calling the library provided by the SDK.

	```swift
	import UIKit
	import AWSAuthCore
	import AWSAuthUI

	class SampleViewController: UIViewController {

	 override func viewDidLoad() {

	     super.viewDidLoad()

	     // Call the showSignIn method from your `viewDidLoad` method
	     // The showSignIn() method will check if the user is logged in,
	     // and if the user is not logged in, it will present a sign-in UI using the navigation controller the view is part of.
	     showSignIn()
	 }

	 func showSignIn() {
	     if !AWSSignInManager.sharedInstance().isLoggedIn {
	        AWSAuthUIViewController
	          .presentViewController(with: self.navigationController!,
	               configuration: nil,
	               completionHandler: { (provider: AWSSignInProvider, error: Error?) in
	                  if error != nil {
	                      print("Error occurred: \(String(describing: error))")
	                  } else {
	                      // Sign in successful.
	                  }
	               })
	     }
	 }
	}
	```

	Choose the run icon (|play|) in the top left of the Xcode window or type Cmd+R to build and run your app. You should see our pre-built sign-in UI for your app. Checkout the next steps to learn how to :ref:`customize your UI <add-aws-mobile-user-sign-in-customize>`.

       `A library that caches and federates a login provider authentication token using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, caches the federated AWS credentials, and handles the sign-in flow.`

## Add sign-out

Sign-out code example. This call should be invoked on a UI activity like a button press triggered by the end user. E.g. `onSignOutButtonClicked` action of sign out button in your app.

	```swift
	AWSSignInManager.sharedInstance().logout(completionHandler: {(result: Any?, error: Error?) in
		// Note: The showSignIn() method used below was added by us previously while integrating the sign-in UI.
		self.showSignIn()
	})
	```
